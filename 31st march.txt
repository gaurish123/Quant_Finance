Hypothesis testing

Null - by default this is true
Alternate  - if we refute null hypothesis


Normal distribution 
statement - whether given sample is coming from normal distribution

Null (Ho) - yes, it is coming from normal
Alternate (H1)- no it is not coming from normal

p value - probability of getting sample such extreme as this one, assuming null hypothesis is true



if p value < 0.05 - null is rejected
if p value >= 0.05 - null is not rejected


p value - what is the probability of getting such data just by chance?

heigher kurtosis means lesser sd

Normality tests

2)




--normal-normal plot or q-q plot  - checks if distribution is normal, skewness
--Boxplot  - whether there are outliers in the data


(x - min(x))/ (max(x) - min(x))


Box - Cox Tranformation

y is original data point
hen y^(alpha)
even after transformation series should be increasing in nature

1,2,3,4,5.....

1,1,1,1,......

y^(alpha)


100,101,102,.......999, 1000   
log, base 10
2,2.1,........2.99, 3
