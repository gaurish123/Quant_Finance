t distribution - 2 parameter needs to input , n, degree of freedom


normal distribution - DOF are infinity
t distributon - degree of freedom are less than infinity

skewness - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness#/media/File:Negative_and_positive_skew_diagrams_(English).svg
concave means right skewed
convex means left skewed

if a distribution is looking concave at one side and convex at other side means that distribution has heavy tails




for a right skewed graph 25th percentile will be lesser as compare to normal but 75th percentile will be greater, concave in nature

for a left skewed graph 25th percentile will be greater as compare to normal but 75th percentile will be lesser, convex in nature







Central Limit Theorum -  as sample size increases, mean of a sample distribution follows normal distribution  (2 conditions) - sample must be independent to each other, sample must be identically distributed - IID
Law of large number = sample mean converges to population mean as sample size increases

both left and right outlier are extreame for sp return than dm/dollar rate
