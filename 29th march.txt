Stationarity of a time series

1) mean should not change with time
2) varince should not change with time
3) covariance should be function of lag only.

Y(t) and Y(t-1)  =cor1

Y(t-5) and Y(t-6)  = cor2

Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4.........    Y(t)  time series

10,21,12,21,34,34 coming from normal

null hypothesis - N(mean, varince)

10 mean,0.4 var  - normal curve





sum of normal distribution is also normal distribution

Percentile, Quentile


1.2.3.4......100 
    
Fn(25)  25th percentile


how to calculate percentile from normal distribution


F(x) = P(X<=x) = Sum(P(X = xi))  where 1=1,2,3....x

cumulative density function

P(X<=12) = 25th percentile
